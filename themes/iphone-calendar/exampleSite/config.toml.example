# iPhone Calendar Theme - Example Configuration

This file shows example configurations for using the iPhone Calendar theme.

## Basic hugo.toml Configuration

```toml
baseURL = 'https://example.org/'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'My Community Calendar'
theme = 'iphone-calendar'

[params]
  description = 'Community events and activities'
  author = 'Your Name'

[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    name = 'Calendar'
    url = '/calendar/'
    weight = 10
```

## Using with Multiple Themes

You can use the iPhone Calendar theme alongside other themes like PaperMod:

```toml
# iPhone Calendar will be checked first for layouts,
# falling back to PaperMod for other pages
theme = ['iphone-calendar', 'PaperMod']
```

## Calendar Page Front Matter

Create a page at `content/calendar.md`:

```markdown
+++
title = 'Event Calendar'
layout = 'calendar'
draft = false
+++

Welcome to our community calendar!
```

## Event Data Structure

Place event data files in `data/aggregate_feed/`:

**File: data/aggregate_feed/202501.json**
```json
[
  {
    "summary": "Town Meeting",
    "start": "2025-01-15T19:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-01-15T21:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "summary": "Community BBQ",
    "start": "2025-01-20T12:00:00Z",
    "end": "2025-01-20T15:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom CSS Variables

Create `assets/css/custom.css`:

```css
:root {
  /* Override accent color */
  --cal-accent: #FF6B6B;
  
  /* Override event colors */
  --cal-blue: #4ECDC4;
  --cal-green: #95E1D3;
}
```

Then reference it in your baseof.html or add to theme:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ (resources.Get "css/custom.css").RelPermalink }}">
```

### Multiple Event Sources

You can have multiple JSON files for different months:

```
data/
  aggregate_feed/
    202501.json  (January 2025 events)
    202502.json  (February 2025 events)
    202503.json  (March 2025 events)
```

The theme will automatically load all files in the aggregate_feed directory.

## Tips

1. **Event Colors**: Events are automatically assigned one of 8 colors based on a hash of their title
2. **All-Day Events**: Events with start time 00:00:00 and duration >= 24 hours are shown as "all-day"
3. **Time Zones**: Use ISO 8601 format with timezone (e.g., `2025-01-15T19:00:00Z` for UTC)
4. **Accessibility**: Users can toggle between light/dark themes and enable color-blind mode
5. **Mobile**: The theme is fully responsive and optimized for touch devices

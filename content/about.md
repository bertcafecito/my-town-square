# About My Town Square

My Town Square was created to make it easier for Bayonne residents to discover local community events without the need for social media.

We believe staying connected to your community shouldn't require scrolling through multiple sources or maintaining social media accounts. My Town Square aggregates local events in one convenient place, making it simple to discover what's happening in our town.

## What We Do

- **Aggregate Local Events** - We collect event information from various community sources
- **Simple Calendar View** - Browse events in an easy-to-use calendar format
- **Family-Friendly Focus** - Highlighting activities suitable for all ages
- **No Social Media Required** - Access everything without needing any social media accounts

## Get Involved

This is a community resource built for the people of Bayonne. If you have suggestions or would like to help improve this platform, please visit our [Support](/support/) page.
